It can be seen that the puchase by men are higher than that of women. The `Yes` represents those who purchased bike and `No`represents those who did not.
From the analysis i will recommend that there are incentives put in place to attract more women to buy bicycles like:
  1. Giving a 6 months warranty with parts replacement
  2. Running discounts sales on bikes 
- Customer Commute: This is the distance or miles each individual travels on bike from their homes to their workplace<p>

The table above shows the distance that individuals travel from home to work and whether they purchased a bike or not. The analysis shows that those who travel between 0-1 mile are higher than those who travel more than 10 miles. Also those who did not purchase a bike are higher than those who did.
- Customer Age Bracket: This shows the age range of individuals who purchased a bike and those who did not<p>

<P>
I created a dashboard for the tables and inserted slicers to connect all the tables. With this when any of the slicers are clicked it will show data pertaining to that particular statistics<p>
